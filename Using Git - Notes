local use of git on laptop

    git init => creates a new git repository
    
    git status => 
    
    git add readme.txt => adds readme.txt to commit stage
    
    git commit => commits changes that are on the stage
                  add commit comment
    
    git commit -m 'commit comment'
    
    git log => shows commits and comments
    
    git add . => tells git to stage everything for the commit
    
    git add *.html => stages justs html files to the commit
    
    git commit -a -m 'comment for commit' => the -a adds all files being tracked to the stage for the commit.
    
    touch .getignore => creates an ignore file, open and add file types to ignore (e.g. log files add *.log to .gitignore)
    
Branching and merging

    git branch MyBranch => creates a new branch called MyBranch
    
    git checkout MyBranch => switches to the MyBranch branch
    
    git checkout master => switch back to the main branch (always called master)
    
    Merging:  Always want to be on the destination branch (master)
    git merge MyBranch => merges MyBranch into the master branch
    
    git mergetool
    
    Example:   working on a branch, but not ready to commit.
    if you switch to another branch the changes will follow.
    Use command => git stash    to temporarily capture the changes, then free to move to another branch without impact
    Use command => git stash apply  to apply the stashed changes back to the branch you are working on.
    
Remote repositories    
    
    remember - everything is still happening locally.  have to manually fetch and push from remote repository
    
    git remote => lists current remote repositories
    
    use clone link from github
    
    git clone <link>  => creates a clone of all of the repository on the local machine
    
    git remote -v => shows the origin links that are associated with the repository
    
    git fetch origin => gets all of the updates from the links and dowloads them to the local machine, but does not merge
    
    git pull origin => gets all of the updates and merges them into the local repository
    
    git push origin master => sends all of the changes to the remote repository and puts them on the master branch
    
    git remote add MyRepo <link> => adds another remote repository
